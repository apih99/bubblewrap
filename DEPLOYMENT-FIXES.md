# 🔧 Deployment Fixes Applied

## ❌ Issues Resolved

### 1. **GitHub Actions Cache Error**
**Error:** `Some specified paths were not resolved, unable to cache dependencies`

**Root Cause:** The workflow was trying to cache based on `package-lock.json` which didn't exist initially.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed cache dependency path from Node.js setup
- Simplified workflow to use `working-directory` instead of `cd` commands
- Removed complex caching that was causing issues

### 2. **Terser Build Error**
**Error:** `terser not found. Since Vite v3, terser has become an optional dependency`

**Root Cause:** Vite config was set to use `terser` for minification but it wasn't installed.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed minification from `terser` to `esbuild` (faster and built-in)
- Added `terser` as dev dependency (backup option)
- Tested successful build locally

## ✅ Current Status

### **Workflow Fixed:**
```yaml
# Now uses working-directory for cleaner commands
- name: Install dependencies
  working-directory: bubble-wrap-surprise
  run: npm install

- name: Build
  working-directory: bubble-wrap-surprise
  run: npm run build
```

### **Build Config Fixed:**
```javascript
// vite.config.js
build: {
  minify: 'esbuild', // Faster, built-in minifier
  // ... other options
}
```

### **Dependencies Added:**
- ✅ `terser` (dev dependency - backup minifier)
- ✅ All packages installed and verified
- ✅ `package-lock.json` generated

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Commit and push all changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🔧 Fix deployment issues: workflow and build config"
git push
```

2. **GitHub Actions will now:**
   - ✅ Install dependencies without cache errors
   - ✅ Build successfully with esbuild minification
   - ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically

3. **Your site will be live at:**
   - 🌐 `https://apih99.github.io/bubblewrap`
